### Working with SVGs

Because of how Sketch exports SVGs, they might come with repeated ids. If you
see that the SVG images are not being displayed correctly, change those ids into
something unique.

Also, try to optimize the SVGs using a tool like [svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
